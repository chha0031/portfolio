She is a student of Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. In Her childhood, equipped with a simple smartphone, she embarked on a passion quest to capture the exquisite essence of the environment- ranging from the vivid tones of sunset to the delicate flowers. This blossoming passion ignited a voyage of exploration and learning. Recognizing the constraints of her smartphone, Chhaya decided to purchase her inaugural entry-level DSLR camera. This marked the commencement of her journey to grasp the essential principles of photography- encompassing comprehension of exposure, shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Photography classes at college by her professor, Sean Systma, became her guide as she explored various configurations and methodologies. With a strong foundation in place, she delved deeper into photography theory.  She applied concepts such as the rule of thirds, guiding lines, and the enchantment of the golden hour, all the while refining her abilities with every press of the cameraâ€™s shutter. While delving into different genres, she unearthed her natural inclination towards landscapes and portraits. Driven by a desire for development, she became a member of nearby photography clubs and virtual discussion boards. By showcasing her work and obtaining insights from seasoned photographers, she gained insights into aspects needing enhancement. This constructive critique ignited her resolve to hone her method and transform her style. As her expertise advanced, she directed her attention toward weaving narratives within her images. She immortalized the elation of children playing in the park, the tranquility of an aged couple clasping hands, and the unfiltered emotions of urban life. Each picture evolved into a segment of the broader tale she wove through her camera lens. Although she had accomplished much, she acknowledged the perpetual evolution within the photography domain.
